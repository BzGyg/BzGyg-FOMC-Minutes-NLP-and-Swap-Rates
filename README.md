# Analyzing FOMC Impact: Leveraging NLP for Sentiment Scores and Swap Rate Predictions
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes provide essential insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and economic outlook. By analyzing NLP-derived sentiment and thematic scores from these minutes, this example seeks to explore whether these qualitative measures correlate with and potentially predict quantitative movements in federal swap rates. The research utilizes a linear statistical model to assess the predictive power of NLP scores, aiming to provide insights into how market expectations of future interest rates are influenced by FOMC communications. The results could offer valuable implications for enhancing prediction models and decision-making processes in financial markets.
